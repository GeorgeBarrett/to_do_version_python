## to_do_version_python

this is a terminal based todo application that allows users to add items to a todo file, give them priority, delete them, list them and move them to a done file once they have been completed.

## usage through terminal

to add: python3 todo.py add "buy the new truffle infused cheddar from the wholefood shop down the road"

to list: python3 todo.py list

to delete: python3 todo.py delete 2 (this will delete the second item in the todo file)

to do: python3 todo.py do 6 (this will move item six from the todo file to the done file)

to prioritise: python3 todo.py 2 a (this will give the second item in the todo file the priority of A (case-insensitive)). A being the highest and Z being the lowest. When the list function is used, items with the highest priority wll appear at the top of the list. Items without a priority assigned will appear below
